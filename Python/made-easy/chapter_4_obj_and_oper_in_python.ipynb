    "#### Answer the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a Variable in Python? How is it different from an object?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables in python are just pointers. They do not have any value in themselves, but they point to the object they are assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An object is a data structure in Python, representing any value (like numbers, strings, lists, etc.). Everything in Python is an object, including functions and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the convention to name a variable in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Variable names can contain only letters, number and underscores.\n",
    "    * Var names can't be started with numbers. ~~5Finger~~\n",
    "    * Var names can't contain spaces. ~~sales data~~, correct option is sales_data.\n",
    "    * Var names are case sensitive. Sales and sales are two different variables.\n",
    "    * You can't use reserved names such as: any, break, try and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the advantages of having built-in objects in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Built-in objects making easier to perform common tasks without requiring custom implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What does immutable means? What objects are immutable in Python?** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Objects whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What do you mean by an object's Identity? How is it different from its type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Object's identity refers to its unique location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Type defines what kind of object it is and what behavior (methods, operations) it supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What do chr() and ord() functions do? How are they related to one another?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The chr() and ord() functions in Python are used for converting between characters and their corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    chr() - `converts an integer `(Unicode code point) into the corresponding character.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ord() - `converts a character` into its corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is an operator? How many types of Operators are there in Python? Name them all.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    An operator in Python is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands (values or variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "    Comparison Operators\n",
    "    Conditional Operator\n",
    "    Logical Operators\n",
    "    Identity Operators\n",
    "    Bitwise Operators\n",
    "    Membership Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **/ And //, both are division operators. What is the difference between them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    / - floating-point division, always returns a floating-point number\n",
    "    // - floor division, Divide x by y and round the answer down to the nearest integer value. If one of the values is a float you'll get back a float\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What value do the logical operators return?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    These operators are used to perform logical operations, and they return either a boolean value (True or False)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the importance of Indentation in Python Programming language?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Indentation is used to define the structure of the program by grouping statements into blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How do you write comments in Python? Why are they important**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comments are used to add explanatory notes or descriptions within the code\n",
    "\n",
    "    They help programmers and others reading the code understand its purpose and functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can write a single-line comment by placing a hash symbol # before the comment text.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How to change the order of evaluation in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most common way to change the order of evaluation in Python is to use parentheses ()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What is the difference between a logical line and a physical line?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A physical line refers to a single line of text in the source code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A logical line is a unit of code that Python interprets as a single statement or command, regardless of how many physical lines it spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example with multiple physical lines forming a single logical line**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
