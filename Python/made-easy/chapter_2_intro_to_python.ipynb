    "#### What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a Free and Open Source, interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural) object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming language should be easy to learn & easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular programming languages for DS are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* R\n",
    "* SQL\n",
    "* C++\n",
    "* Java\n",
    "* Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just started to learn programming language it should follow certain criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Already mainstream and firmly established in the Software Development industry.\n",
    "* Top-ranked in the renowned programming languages ranking websites.\n",
    "* Popularity is increasing or stable and not sharply decreasing.\n",
    "* They have a large set of libraries, frameworks, tooling support, and have a large community.\n",
    "* They are demanding in the job market with a good salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is extremely capable of data mining, data analytics and Machine learning.\n",

    "#### Python Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatics (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. Its implementation began in December 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Python as compared to other Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is simple to use, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, it can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Philosophy of Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "The language's core philosophy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beautiful is better than ugly\n",
    "* Explicit is better than implicit\n",
    "* Simple is better than complex \n",
    "* Complex is better than complicated\n",
    "* Readability counts"

    "#### Advantage of Python over other languages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple - reading a python code feels like reading english. Simplicity is one of the core strengths of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to learn - syntax is extremely simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Free and Open Source - Python is FREE, Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libré and Open Source Software).\n",
    "\n",
    "* High Level Language -  not worry about low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, high-level programming languages closer to human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Portable - Python can be used on Windows, GNU/Linux, Macintosh, Solaris, Palm OS, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted - the program is run directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecode and then translates this into the native language of the computer and then runs it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is an Interpreter?\n",
    "\n",
    "* By definition, an interpreter is a type of computer program that directly executes the instructions written in some programming or scripting language. By direct execution, we mean that it doesn't require the instructions to be compiled into a machine language program first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object Oriented \n",
    "* Extensible - Python is easily extensible with C/C++/Java code, and easily emendable in applications.\n",
    "* Extensive Libraries - python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Python for Beginners!\n",
    "\n",
    "For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed language seems unnatural. Python's interactive interpreter enables students to test language features while they're programming. They can keep a window with the interpreter running while they enter their program's source in another window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 is regarded as the future of Python and is the version of the language that is currently in development.\n",
    "The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task. Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, an interpreter is a type of computer program, which directly executes instructions written in a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 popular Interpreters:\n",
    "* IPython - default Interpreter, that comes with Python.\n",
    "* CPython - one of the most popular, written on C and Python. CPython can be considered a compiler, because it converts Python code into bytecode before interpretation.\n",
    "* IronPython - this is an implementation of a programming language Python for the platform .NET, which uses Python and .NET libraries.\n",
    "* Jython - works on Java platform, combination Java and Python, converts Python code into Java byte-code. allows you to run Python code on any machine on which you have installed JVM. \n",
    "* PyPy - this Python interpreter is about 4.4 times\n",
    "faster than CPython\n",
    "* PythonNet\n",
    "* Stackless Python  "

    "#### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is an Open source software. Is it same as being a freeware?\n",
    "* No, freeware is not the same as Open Source Software.\n",
    "2. Are all freeware software Open source? If not, What is the difference?\n",
    "* Not all free programs are open source, the developer can restrict any freeware feature. Open source programs can be modified and improved by anyone\n",
    "3. Python supports dynamic typing. What do you understand by dynamic typing?\n",
    "* When you write code you don't need to worry about types of variables when you define in.\n",
    "4. Recall 5 Most popular programming languages for Data Scientists?\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* R\n",
    "* Java\n",
    "* C++\n",
    "* Matlab\n",
    "5. What are the strength of Python over C programming language?\n",
    "* Python is simple to use, programs written in Python much shorter then programs in C. Python support dynamic typing, C doesn't.\n",
    "6. Python is portable software. What does \"portability\" means in this context?\n",
    "* Python can be used on any OS system: Windows, MacOs, Unix etc.\n",
    "7. What is the difference in being \"Extensible\" and being \"Embeddable\"?\n",
    "* Extensible is more about adding new features, Embeddable means that it can be integrated into another program as a component.\n",
    "8. What is the meaning of IDE? How is it different from Terminal?\n",
    "* IDE - integrated development environment. It's application that provides features like version control, debugger, interpreter integration. Terminal doesn't have all this features.\n",
    "9. How are the \"markdown cell\" different from \"code cell\" in Jupyter notebook? What are their purposes?\n",
    "* Markdown cells are used to write explanatory text, code cells are used to write and execute code.\n",
